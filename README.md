*********************************************
NOTE: There has been certain assumptions made. 
Although the customer will get percentage discount, $5 per $100 is also provided to him on top of the percentage discount. The $5 discount goes for the overall bill amount after percentange discount. For instance, if an item is $400 and the customer is an employee, he gets 30% discount which will be $120. The discounted price will be $280. $5 discount on $280 would be $10. The net payable bill by the customer will be $270.
