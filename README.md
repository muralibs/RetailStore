The test suite is provided for running all the test cases. The class name is RetailStoreTestSuite.


*********************************************
NOTE: There has been certain assumptions made. It is not clear in the problem statement whether the $5 per $100 discount has to be applied after the percentage discount is applied on non-grocery items.
So, after the customer gets the percentage discount, $5 per $100 is also provided to him on top of the percentage discount. The $5 discount goes for the overall bill amount after percentage discount. 

For instance, if a non-grocery item is $400 and the customer is an employee, he gets 30% discount which will be $120. The discounted price will be $280. $5 discount on $280 would be $10. The net payable bill by the customer will be $270.
